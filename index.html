				<h2>What we do</h2>
            <p>The Parker Group at the University of California, Irvine, specializes in infectious disease epidemiology with a focus on global health. Our multidisciplinary approach integrates geographic information systems (GIS), spatial data science and spatial analysis, molecular techniques, advanced statistical modeling, demography, and anthropology. We aim to unravel the complex interactions between environmental factors and infectious disease dynamics, particularly in under-resourced and conflict-affected regions.</p>            
				<h2>Research Focus</h2>
            <p>Our research addresses persistent barriers to healthcare access that fuel the spread of infectious diseases. These barriers are multifaceted, encompassing geographic, technological, biological, socio-cultural, and economic dimensions. A core objective of our work is to identify these barriers and develop strategies to overcome them, thereby improving healthcare delivery and outcomes in vulnerable populations.</p>
				<h2>Collaborative Efforts</h2>
            <p>Our work is highly collaborative, involving partnerships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), governmental organizations (GOs), and universities in endemic regions. These collaborations ensure that our research is not only academically rigorous but also translational, directly informing public health interventions that are scalable and effective.</p> 
				<h2>Geographic and Disease Focus</h2>
            <p>Our research spans multiple geographic areas, including Cambodia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Laos, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Syria, Thailand, Yemen, and the U.S.A. We focus on a variety of infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, arboviral diseases (including dengue and Zika), infections of the central nervous system, cholera, COVID-19, and more.</p>
				<h2>Key Projects and Approaches</h2>
            <p>Vector-Borne Diseases: Using earth observation data, we identify environmental predictors of vector habitats. For instance, in Cambodia, we have developed geospatial models to predict dengue virus infection hotspots based on antibody responses to <i>Aedes</i> salivary proteins​​.</p>
			<p>Healthcare for Displaced Populations: Our work addresses significant gaps in healthcare for migrants and refugees in various regions. This work includes vaccination, antenatal care, and treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in migrant populations. For example, our research has illustrated challenges with vaccination documentation for migrant children, and that easy access to antenatal clinics is crucial for better pregnancy outcomes​​​​.</p>
			<p>Malaria Research: Our malaria research spans multiple regions, including Southeast Asia and Northeast Africa. We focus on targeted malaria interventions such as reactive case detection and mass drug administration. Our studies demonstrate the importance of community-based early diagnosis and treatment clinics, which can significantly reduce malaria incidence. We have also shown the effectiveness of mass drug administration in providing herd protection against malaria​​​​.</p>
			<p>Geospatial Technologies and Data Science: We leverage cutting-edge geospatial technologies and data science methodologies to track human movement patterns and predict disease outbreaks. For example, in Ethiopia, we use mobile phone data to understand population mobility and its implications for malaria epidemiology​​.</p>
				<h2>Impact and Vision</h2>
            <p>The Parker Group is dedicated to advancing public health through a combination of innovative research, technology, low-tech approaches, anthropology, and community engagement. By integrating diverse scientific disciplines and engaging with local communities, we aim to develop effective, scalable interventions that improve healthcare access and outcomes for neglected populations. These populations often face barriers due to citizenship status, geographic isolation, socio-political isolation, or being located in conflict zones. Our vision is a world where everyone has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their geographic or socio-economic circumstances.</p>
