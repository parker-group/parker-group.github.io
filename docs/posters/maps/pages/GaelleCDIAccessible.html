            <p>Travel times showed considerable heterogeneity across the districts particularly along the coast, ranging from 23 minutes to 6 hours in the dry season (left column) and 38 minutes to 10 hours during the wet season (right column). 59 districts had a mean travel time of more than 2 hours in the dry season (Figure C), this increased to 85 districts during the wet seasons (Figure C). These marginalised districts are located in north and west areas in the dry areas which shift to most of the country in the wet season. The rasters shown in Figures A and B were generated using AccessMod v5/</p>
