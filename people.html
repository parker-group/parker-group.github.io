                    <p>As an Ivorian Ph.D. student at the University of California in Irvine, I am passionate about raising awareness and educating populations about infectious diseases. My research interests lie in understanding the ecology of vector-borne diseases, remote sensing, and healthcare accessibility, with a focus on spatial epidemiology, infectious diseases, and maternal & child health in West Africa. I have extensive training in statistical and epidemiological approaches, as well as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data science. Additionally, my background as a first-generation student and an Ivorian woman adds a unique perspective to my work.

                    <p>Maia is doctoral student in Global Health at UC Irvine, where she researches the impact of conflict on health. Her work focuses primarily on the protracted conflicts in Syria and Yemen and ways in which the politicization of health and attacks on infrastructure during these conflicts have impacted the countries’ infectious disease burdens. She uses syndromic surveillance, remote sensing, infectious disease epidemiology, and spatial analysis heavily in her work. She is also passionate about working in close collaboration with local scholars and NGOS, in addition to mentoring global health students. She earned a BA in Community Health and Middle Eastern Studies from Tufts University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa.

                    <h4>PhD Student</h4>
                    <p>I am a Peruvian political scientist with a Master’s Degree in Comparative Politics (Sciences Po Paris). I am interested in linking social sciences to health sciences and politics to health to understand and to help solve health disparities. I have worked for 6 years as a public servant in Peru as an advisor for the Ministery of Development and Social Inclusion and the Ministery of Education. For 4 and a half years I was the chair of the Political Science School at Antonio Ruiz de Montoya University and had to manage the COVID-19 crisis as an education services provider. Since 2017, I have participated in some research projects focused on the linkages between rural and urban environments with a focus on rural youth. I am now interested in analyzing the way social determinants and processes interacts with environmental determinants and how this affects health, especially infectious diseases such as dengue fever.
